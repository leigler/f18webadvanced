# Assignment 3: Instrument


## Week 1

For October 19, prepare three distinctly separate directions for this assignment. You may sketch these out in static or dynamic sequence (Illustrator, Sketch, InVision, Principle, XD, code). Your sketches should clearly communicate what information the website catalogues, and how the website becomes customized over multiple visits. Be prepared to present and discuss each of your directions.

Feel free to begin to look at some Javascript Libraries that you could apply/use. 

## Brief

Read [Benevolent Deception in Human Computer Interaction](http://www.cond.org/deception.pdf) by Eytan Adar, Desney S. Tan, and Jaime Teevan. Consider the examples and design strategies that the authors outline as potentially problematic and reflect on instances where you have either designed or engaged with moments of benevolent deception.

Consider how this text relates to the following assignment:

This assignment is meant to expand students’ understanding of customized user
experience and interactivity. 
Using your knowledge of Javascript so far, design and develop a linear relationship between the user and the visual rendering of a site. You will utilize [Javascript cookies](https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie) to track (and subsequently modify) your user&rsquo;s behaviour, and a Javascript Library of your choice to customize your user&rsquo; interactions. Consider what information you store about the user and their behaviour (i.e. time-visited, mouse movement, time spent on site), and how this information is relayed back to the user upon each visit.

Questions to consider include: 
- What is a customized web experience?
- What information might you utilize to customize a web experience? 
- Should a user be aware that their experience is customized? If so, at what stage is this fact revealed (or more abstractly: how can timing influence a user&rsquo;s opinion about a customized experience)?
- Does your site have a goal? How might customizing your user&rsquo;s experience allow that goal to manifest?
