## Assignment 1: Index

Read [Prof. Dr. Style](http://contemporary-home-computing.org/prof-dr-style/) by Olia Lialina. 

Take the github page that you set up in todayâ€™s class and convert it into a living index of your work over this semester. Think about how this index will grow a change in reaction to the projects you will add. Your index should be built responsively (work on desktop and mobile).
