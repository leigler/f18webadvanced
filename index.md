In-Class

### Class Pattern Sharing
- Today, everyone will set up their laptops with their pattern/interface along with a text-editor open. We will individually rotate clockwise through the patterns, spending approximately 5–7 minutes on each pattern. For each pattern you interact with, take screenshots of your manipulations, and respond to the questions below in the text editor.
- We will then take a moment to review the feedback you were given and upload/send a few (at least two) of your favorite screenshots to eigll343@newschool.edu.
- Finally, we will review the screenshots and discuss. 

### Questions:

1) How is the interface integrated into the pattern? How well does the interface complement the pattern?

2) How does the interface allow you to manipulate the pattern?

3) Do you wish you had more control over the pattern? Explain your answer.

4) What improvements to the interface would you suggest? (Is there anything that is unclear, or behaves in an unexpected way?)
