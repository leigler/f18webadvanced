## Google Maps API

The Google Map Javascript API is not only a practical API, but one that gives you access to one of the most powerful (and [politically dangerous](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2016/aug/10/google-maps-disputed-territories-palestineishere)) mapping technologies available to the public.

The Maps API consists of a function `initMap(){}` which begins with an new instance of a `google.maps.Map()` (this function defines the position, zoom level, map type, etc). In this example we also utilize the HTML5 geolocation method `navigator.geolocation` to determine the user&rsquo;s location (this requires the user's consent).

### Setting up your API Key

Set up your API Key following [these](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) instructions. Google Maps asks to set up billing, but the Map API is free.
- generate Project
- go to your console, make sure you&rsquo;re in the right project
- select "Maps Javascript API"
- click "enable"
- navigate to "Credentials"
- generate API Key, click close
- copy API Key into your code

### The Map
A basic map template can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/map-geolocation).


### Styling
- Documentation on styling your map can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/styling).
- A complete reference of values for `featureType`, `elementType` and `stylers` can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/style-reference). Notice that these adopt a JSON-style syntax. 

### Controls

For custom controls (and limiting interfaces), you can view documentation [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/controls).

## Boilerplate Files
Your boilerplate file can be downloaded [here](assets/files/google-api-boiler.zip). 

## Working Files

Working files will be added to the site after class.
