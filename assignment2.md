# Assignment 1: Pattern


## Brief
Read Anni Albersâ€™ chapter on [Designing as Visual Organization](http://s3.amazonaws.com/arena-attachments/2597972/2065c555bbd04503da9df3d3ec5052dc.pdf?1535137003) and skim through her weaving patterns. Also read [Against Ordinary Language: The Language of the Body](http://s3.amazonaws.com/arena-attachments/2598476/32ee9b74216346c153e4600a745e0586.pdf?1535145818) by Kathy Acker and consider how what she describes relates to patterns, repetition, and design. 

Bring in a question for each reading, and consider how these texts relate to the following assignment:

You will write a JavaScript program which uses loops and if statements to create a module-based generative pattern. Using a single pattern unit (a module) (think: `div` ) that changes over the course of its output. Your unit should iterate at least 50 times. With each iteration, your unit should somehow modify itself (content, size, color, rotation, shape, texture). Your pattern should have at least 2 variables of change (ex: content, color), is allowed to repeat itself (i.e. be a pattern), and is allowed to be as abstract or literal as you want (it can tell a story, or it can be an exercise in form).

## Week 1 (Part 1/4)

*For next week* (Sept 14), bring in a single-page github page with a fully functioning for loop that iterates at least 50 times.
