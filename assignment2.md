# Assignment 1: Pattern

## Week 2 (Part 2/4)

 Consider the feedback you recieved today in your small groups, and the overarching feedback produced out of the class discussion.

*For next week* (Sept 21), you will iterate and expand on your pattern. Revisit how you might manipulate layout, use css position properties like `relative`, `absolute`, and `fixed`, and take advantage of any default formal properties of a webpage (think of scrolling, view height, hashes) to further your design. 

Questions to consider: 
- At what pace does your pattern reveal itself?
- Does the scroll animate your pattern at all? 
- What aspects of your module stay consistent and create cohesiveness and rhythm across the animation? What aspects create inconsistencies? 


<!-- Animate your pattern using the `setTimeout` function. Carefully consider what design changes you should implement now that your site is no longer static. If you are interested in introducing a random element to your pattern, feel free to. 

Questions to consider: 
- At what pace does your pattern reveal itself?
- Does your unit overwrite itself, or is it additive?
- Does the scale of your module shift now that it is animating? 
- What aspects of your module stay consistent and create cohesiveness and rhythm across the animation? What aspects create inconsistencies?

## Week 1 (Part 1/4)

For Sept 14, bring in a single-page github page with a fully functioning for loop that iterates at least 50 times.

## Brief
Read Anni Albersâ€™ chapter on [Designing as Visual Organization](http://s3.amazonaws.com/arena-attachments/2597972/2065c555bbd04503da9df3d3ec5052dc.pdf?1535137003) and skim through her weaving patterns. Also read [Against Ordinary Language: The Language of the Body](http://s3.amazonaws.com/arena-attachments/2598476/32ee9b74216346c153e4600a745e0586.pdf?1535145818) by Kathy Acker and consider how what she describes relates to patterns, repetition, and design. 

Bring in a question for each reading, and consider how these texts relate to the following assignment:

You will write a JavaScript program which uses loops and if statements to create a module-based generative pattern. Using a single pattern unit (a module) (think: `div` ) that changes over the course of its output. Your unit should iterate at least 50 times. With each iteration, your unit should somehow modify itself (content, size, color, rotation, shape, texture). Your pattern should have at least 2 variables of change (ex: content, color), is allowed to repeat itself (i.e. be a pattern), and is allowed to be as abstract or literal as you want (it can tell a story, or it can be an exercise in form).
