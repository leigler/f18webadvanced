# Assignment 2: Pattern

## Final Preparations

*For next week* (Oct 12), consider the feedback you received today, and resolve your pattern and interface for a full class critique. 

This means: 
- Be sure that your pattern is uploaded and accessible as a github page from your github repository in its final form.
- Testing your pattern/interface to make sure all the files are properly linked/working on your github.
- Making sure that your site is responsive to various screen sizes. We will be presenting the pattern sites on the classroom&rsquo;s installed computer/monitor. 

Some further things to consider: 
- how can you indicate that one can click on something
- how to potentially smooth out transitions between states through `css transition`
- when does a hover work, when does a click work? 
- are there aspects that can be simplified that allow the pattern to speak more?
- can the project become more complex the further one interacts with it? 



## Week 4 (Part 4/4)

*For next week* (Oct 5) Introduce a basic interface into your pattern. Over the next two weeks you will work on this interface and how it might enhance our experience of your pattern. 

The interface is a moment of intervention: it has the opportunity to contextualize (think: brand) your pattern. Think about the examples we looked at today: 
- [Click Click Click](https://clickclickclick.click/) by Studio Moniker
- [Interrupt 3](http://www.irq3.interrupt.xyz/) by This is our work
- [fonts.google.com](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [aCCeSsions: The Overview Effect](https://accessions.org/issue-2/)

This interface should allow a viewer/user of your pattern to influence and control your pattern in some way. Consider how the interface might: 
- manipulate the pattern upon interaction
- Start/stop the pattern&rsquo;s animation
- be revealed or hidden at certain points of the pattern
- change in reaction to the pattern&rsquo;s progress
- clarify or obscure how the pattern works



## Week 3 (Part 3/4)

*For next week* (Sept 28) Animate your pattern using the `setTimeout` function. Carefully consider what design changes you should implement now that your site is no longer static. If you are interested in introducing a random element to your pattern, feel free to. 

Questions to consider: 
- Does your unit overwrite itself, or is it additive?
- How fast does your pattern reveal itself, and in what stages?
- Does the scale of your module shift now that it is animating? 



## Week 2 (Part 2/4)

 Consider the feedback you recieved today in your small groups, and the overarching feedback produced out of the class discussion.

*For next week* (Sept 21), you will iterate and expand on your pattern. Revisit how you might manipulate layout, use css position properties like `relative`, `absolute`, and `fixed`, and take advantage of any default formal properties of a webpage (think of scrolling, view height, hashes) to further your design. 

Questions to consider: 
- At what pace does your pattern reveal itself?
- Does the scroll animate your pattern at all? 
- What aspects of your module stay consistent and create cohesiveness and rhythm across the animation? What aspects create inconsistencies? 


## Week 1 (Part 1/4)

For Sept 14, bring in a single-page github page with a fully functioning for loop that iterates at least 50 times.

## Brief
Read Anni Albersâ€™ chapter on [Designing as Visual Organization](http://s3.amazonaws.com/arena-attachments/2597972/2065c555bbd04503da9df3d3ec5052dc.pdf?1535137003) and skim through her weaving patterns. Also read [Against Ordinary Language: The Language of the Body](http://s3.amazonaws.com/arena-attachments/2598476/32ee9b74216346c153e4600a745e0586.pdf?1535145818) by Kathy Acker and consider how what she describes relates to patterns, repetition, and design. 

Bring in a question for each reading, and consider how these texts relate to the following assignment:

You will write a JavaScript program which uses loops and if statements to create a module-based generative pattern. Using a single pattern unit (a module) (think: `div` ) that changes over the course of its output. Your unit should iterate at least 50 times. With each iteration, your unit should somehow modify itself (content, size, color, rotation, shape, texture). Your pattern should have at least 2 variables of change (ex: content, color), is allowed to repeat itself (i.e. be a pattern), and is allowed to be as abstract or literal as you want (it can tell a story, or it can be an exercise in form).
